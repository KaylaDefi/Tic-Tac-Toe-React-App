# Tic Tac Toe React App

This app is a project I'm working on to learn React in my MIT xPro bootcamp. If you run these files as a React app the browser will display an interactive tic-tac-toe board. The winner is declared once a player gets three-in-a-row. In the future I want to improve this app by adding a more exciting alert upon winning, adding a refresh game button for a rematch, and adding a scoreboard that keeps track of scores between players. I also want to update the styling.
