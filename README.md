# Tic Tac Toe React App

This app is a project I'm working on to learn React in my MIT xPro bootcamp. If you run these files as a React app you will get a tic-tac-toe board and the winner is declared once a player gets three-in-a-row. In the future I want to improve this app but adding a more exciting alert upon winning, add a refresh game button for a rematch, and add a scoreboard that keeps track of scores between players.
